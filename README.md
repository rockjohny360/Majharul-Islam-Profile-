### Walmart Retail Data Analysis

The Walmart retail data analysis dashboard is an interactive visualization tool that provides insights into the sales and profitability of Walmart across different states in the US. The dashboard uses a dataset from Kaggle that contains over 8,400 records of retail transactions.

One of the key features of the dashboard is the distribution of average profit by states. This visualization allows users to quickly identify which states are generating more average profit, and thus focus on those areas for further analysis and improvement.

The dashboard also highlights the profit that is going into loss, giving users an understanding of which areas of the business need attention to prevent further losses. Additionally, the dashboard shows which age ranges are generating maximum profit, providing insights into the target audience for the business.

Other important metrics such as average sale, average profit, and average discount are also displayed, allowing users to analyze the performance of the business over time. The dashboard also provides information about the datasets used and the branding of the Walmart brand.

Finally, the regional quarterly average profit visualization shows the trends of state wise profit over time, allowing users to track the progress of the business and make informed decisions based on the data.

Overall, the Walmart retail data analysis dashboard is an excellent tool for anyone looking to gain insights into the sales and profitability of Walmart, and can be used to identify areas of improvement and optimize the business for greater success.

### Bike Buyers 

![Bike Buyers Dashboard Image](https://github.com/rockjohny360/Portfolio_Majharul/blob/main/Bike%20Buyers%20Dashboard%20Image.PNG?raw=true)

The project involves analyzing a demographic dataset of bike buyers sourced from Kaggle, a popular data science community that provides various datasets for analysis and projects. The dataset includes columns such as ID, Marital Status, Gender, Income, Children, Education, Occupation, Home Owner, Cars, Commute Distance, Region, Age, and Purchased Bike.

The first step in this project involved data cleaning, including removing duplicate data and standardizing the marital status and gender categories. Additionally, age brackets were created using the IF function, categorizing customers into Old, Middle Age, Adolescent, or Invalid based on their age.

Next, three pivot tables were created to analyze different aspects of the dataset. The pivot tables provide insights into the average income of bike buyers, commuting distance, and customer age brackets, helping identify the target audience for bike products.

Finally, a dashboard was created that includes interactive stats and visuals. The interactive features include stats related to marital status, region, education, and occupation, allowing users to filter the data based on these categories. The visuals include the average income per purchase, customer age brackets, and customer commute time, providing insights into the relationship between income, age, and proximity to work or other destinations.

Overall, this project provides valuable insights into the demographic information of bike buyers, helping businesses understand their target audience and make data-driven decisions based on the insights provided.
